# Coffee Quest Chrome Extension

Coffee Quest searches for nearby coffee shops and displays the nearest one to you in a popup with a Google Maps API. 
The coffee shop name is also hyperlinked to a new tab that opens up Google Maps in full view.

Done as part of Headstarter AI's Hackathon 1 in 2024

Unfortunatly did not realize that chrome extension content security policy is strict enough such that it doesn't allow Javascript Maps API, even when customized.
